## Notes:
We could fine tune the pre trained hugging face stable diffuser. We could use figures, graphs, and visuals from textbooks as training data. Luckily, most textbooks include a brief description of these images in the textbook, which we can use as training labels. After fine tuning the model, we can experiment with using automatic prompt fine tuning to achieve better results.
